----> 100Days_of_Code
Accumulated knowledge of the course

Day 01: String Manipulation, Debugging and Variable Naming
#I already knew most of it but it's always good to re-watch what you know.

Days 02: Data Types, Mathematical Operations and Number Manipulation
#I don't understand why f-string isn't the standard way to print :expressionless:.

Day 03: Nested if statements, elif statements and logical operators
#It was so much fun creating the leap year calculator, it was my second time making a nested if statement but it was my first using it with numbers in python. The game itself was pretty simple.

Day 04: Mostly random modules and nested lists manipulation
#Like the first time I encountered 'for loops', the random module open a whole new world for me. Debugging can be as hard as it is to write the code in the first place.

Day 05: Python For Loops
#Using if statements inside for loops can be done with so many different aproaches

Day 06: While Loops
#Personal reminder: use while loops when you don't know how many times you need to iterate a code block.
