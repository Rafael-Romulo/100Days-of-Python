Accumulated knowledge of the course

Day 01: String Manipulation, Debugging and Variable Naming
#I already knew most of it but it's always good to remind

Days 02: Data Types, Mathematical Operations and Number Manipulation
#I don't understand why f-string isn't the standard way to print :expressionless: :expressionless:

Day 03: Nested if statements, elif statements and logical operators
#It was so much fun creating the leap year calculator, it was my second time making a nested if statement but it was my first using it with numbers in python. The game itself was pretty simple.

Day 04: Mostly random modules and nested lists manipulation
